    <p><strong>History of Mercedes</strong></p>
    <p><em>The period after World War I is badly affected by inflation and poor sales figures – especially for luxury goods such as passenger cars. Only strong brands marketed by financially stable companies are able to survive. Businesses are often forced into mergers or partnerships. Competitors for many years, DMG and Benz & Cie. enter into a joint venture in May 1924. They focus on remaining competitive through coordinated designs, production techniques, purchasing strategies, sales and advertising. The joint marketing activities of the “Mercedes” and “Benz” brands are initially handled by the newly founded “Mercedes-Benz Automobil GmbH”. The fusion of the two oldest automotive manufacturers in the world takes place in June 1926 when Daimler-Benz AG is established. The new company presents the first Daimler-Benz product range as early as October at the 1926 Berlin Motor Show. The exhibition sees the unveiling of the first jointly developed passenger car models launched under the new Mercedes-Benz brand name: The 8/38 hp two-litre car (W 02) and the 12/55 hp three-litre model (W 03).</em></p>
